Cohort 3 — Week 1: JavaScript Foundations & Zerodha UI Clone
Overview
This week, I focused on strengthening JavaScript fundamentals and built a basic clone of the Zerodha homepage as part of my learning journey in Cohort 3.

What’s Included
JavaScript basics – Variables, arrays, objects, and functions (javascriptbasics.js, assignment4.js to assignment8.js)

Frontend project – HTML/CSS clone of Zerodha’s homepage (index.html, style.css)

Assets – Images for branding and analytics mockup (zerodhalogo.jpg, burgermenu.png, ZerodhaAnalytics.jpg)

Key Learning Outcomes
Variables, Arrays & Objects: Practised declaring variables, manipulating arrays, and creating/using object literals.

Functions: Wrote multiple functions for greetings, summing numbers, and filtering user lists. Explored using both for loops and array filter methods.

Conditional Logic: Used if-else statements for voting eligibility and gender-based greetings.

Assignments: Filtered users by age & gender and summarised data using functions.

Frontend Skills: Created a responsive Zerodha UI clone using HTML and CSS, and included key design assets.
