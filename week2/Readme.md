📚 Cohort 3 — Week 2: Deep Dive into JavaScript Functions & Data Handling
🚀 What I Accomplished
This week, I focused on mastering JavaScript functions, array manipulations, and object handling by tackling a series of coding challenges. My learning was hands-on, with each file representing a new concept or problem-solving approach. I continued to build my fundamentals and apply them to practical situations that reinforce real-world development skills.

📝 Key Topics Covered
Function Creation: Wrote multiple reusable functions for data processing tasks.
Object Manipulation: Practised creating, accessing, and updating objects and arrays of objects.
Conditional Logic: Utilised conditionals to make functions smarter and more interactive for scenarios like age filters, personalised greetings, and eligibility checks.
Array Methods: Explored both loop-based and higher-order methods (filter) to work with lists of users.
