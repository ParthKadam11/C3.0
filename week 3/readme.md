Cohort 3 — Week 3: TO-DO Apps, DOM Practice & Async Timing ⏳📝
This Week’s Journey
This week was about making stuff happen on the page—building little to-do lists, playing with the DOM, and experimenting with timing in JavaScript.

What’s Inside
Mini TO-DO List Apps 🗒️
Built and updated simple task lists where you can add, display, and delete tasks.
Practised DOM manipulation: creating input fields, updating the page live, and removing elements.
Async JS with setTimeout ⏲️
Made tasks appear/disappear after delays to understand how asynchronous code and setTimeout work in real projects.
Button and Input Handling
Used event listeners for buttons and inputs—making sites “do things” when you click.
Styling & Layout 🎨
Wrote CSS for flexbox layouts and made the UI a bit cleaner (still keeping it basic).

Key Things I Learned
How to grab elements with JS and actually update what's on the page.
Handling inputs and button events to add or delete tasks (not just alerting stuff).
Creating and deleting DOM nodes in real time.
Using setTimeout so tasks can disappear after a delay—basic async understanding.
Keeping code and UI simple but functional, focusing on “how things work”, not just looks.
