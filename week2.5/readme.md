Cohort 3 — Week 2.5: Promises and Basic JavaScript Classes
What I Worked On This Week
This week, I learned about Promises in JavaScript, how to handle asynchronous code better, and started exploring JavaScript Classes — a way to organise code with objects.

Key Topics
Promises
Learned why callbacks can be messy and how Promises make asynchronous code easier to read and manage.
Practised creating and using promises, including resolving and rejecting them.
Made functions that wait for some time using promises and setTimeout.
Worked on an exercise that logs messages with delays one after the other using promise-like structure.
Implemented reading files asynchronously using promises with Node.js's fs module.

JavaScript Classes
Created a simple cube class with properties (height, width, color).
Made methods inside classes to calculate area and print color.
Learned how to create objects (instances) from classes and interact with their methods.
Explored built-in JavaScript classes like Date and Map, and how to use their methods.

Bonus: Bash Scripting (from Cohort 2)

Reflected on previously learning bash scripting and customising terminal environments for a better developer experience.

What I Learned
How to use Promises to better handle delayed or async actions, avoiding callback hell.
Understanding of chaining asynchronous tasks in sequence with delay.
Basics of defining and using JavaScript classes to organize related data and behavior.
Working with native JavaScript classes like Date and Map.
Practiced file reading asynchronously using promises in Node.js.
Got familiar with some bash scripting basics and terminal customization to improve development workflow.
